## Final Statement

By completing all lesson notebooks and additional topics from Big Ideas 3 and 5, I have demonstrated a solid understanding of programming fundamentals using Python. These include data structures, iteration, conditionals, Boolean logic, simulations, and algorithmic thinking. I consistently pushed updates to GitHub, showing version control discipline and personal responsibility in managing my progress.

This unit was critical in preparing me to build real-world software and tackle more advanced CS principles for AP exam.
