Big Idea 3 Blog </h1>

<p style="font-size:100%; color: Blue; font: italic bold 15px Arial, sans-serif;"> Throughout this sprint, the self-start lessons were impactful for me. They allowed me to explore various topics at my own pace, particularly in lessons 3.1, 3.6, and beyond. These lessons gave me the opportunity to solidify concepts I was already familiar with while focusing on specific areas where I needed improvement. This was especially helpful when student-led teaching shifted my attention to the parts I was less confident about. Having a strong understanding of these specific sections ensured I could prepare for the AP Exam effectively, rather than revisiting material I was already comfortable with.

The memory homework and the 3.1 lesson were particularly beneficial in reinforcing these concepts, enhancing both my retention and performance.

Relevance and Challenge: Lesson 3.5, which covered Booleans and Morgan's Law, stood out as a very impactful experience. This topic challenged my understanding, pushing me to go beyond what I initially thought I knew. It was engaging and provided a deeper insight into how logical operations work, making the learning process both stimulating and enjoyable.

Personal Growth and Mastery: One key area of personal growth during this sprint was in Lesson 3.1. In this lesson, I intentionally stepped away from relying heavily on external resources. My focus was to demonstrate my knowledge and how well I could apply it independently. This experience allowed me to measure my personal proficiency, showing me not only what I had mastered but also where I needed to refine my understanding.</p>
