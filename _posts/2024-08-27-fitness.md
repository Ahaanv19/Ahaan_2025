<p style="font-size:100%; color: Blue; font: italic bold 18px Arial, sans-serif;"> In today's panel, the speakers really empashized how important communication is and how important when sharing ideas and thoughts. It is more or at the same level of the abilty to write code. Being able to communicate ideas can help you grow your ranks through companies, and gain more feedback. Even in college classes they follow a very similar structure to what we do in class everyday, with scrums, scrum master, and frontend backend teams, a very similar format and actvities that we do in Mr. Mortenson's class everyday. It is also very important to discuss problems you have, and understanding these problems, help us become more succesful and learn how to solve these  As a result of this panel disscusion, something I will change and investigate will be the art of communication that was discussed in today's pannel, and I will make sure to change the fact that we don't communicate as often as we should, and after learning in the pannel how important communication is, I feel like by improving and changing how much communincation we have with each other on our team, we can become more succesfull, and have more postives.  </p>
