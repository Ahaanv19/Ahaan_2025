# Backend Setup Review Ticket  

## **Accomplishments** 🎉  
### Positives  
- Successfully set up a backend server using Flask.  
- Implemented CORS to handle cross-origin requests effectively.  
- Created an endpoint (`/api/ahaan`) to fetch and display user information dynamically.  
- Achieved smooth communication between the frontend and backend with `fetch` API.  

### Postman Successes  
- Used Postman to test backend API endpoints efficiently.  
- Verified response structure and ensured the data matched expected formats.  
- Debugged minor issues in real-time using Postman’s response and error messages.  

---

## **Struggles** 😅  
### Negatives  
- Initial difficulty with setting up CORS properly, leading to `CORS Policy` errors.  
- Took time to debug the `fetch` call URL mismatch between frontend and backend.  
- JSON parsing issues with unexpected response structures caused minor delays.  

### Postman Struggles  
- Occasionally forgot to update headers or body in Postman, leading to incorrect test results.  
- Faced confusion distinguishing between `GET` and `POST` request setups in some tests.  

---

## **Journey** 🚀  
1. **Backend Initialization**  
   - Started with a basic Flask server setup.  
   - Added the `/api/ahaan` route to serve a JSON response.  

2. **CORS Integration**  
   - Installed and configured Flask-CORS.  
   - Tested frontend-backend communication with updated headers.  

3. **Frontend Testing**  
   - Used Postman to test endpoint functionality before integrating it with the frontend.  
   - Confirmed data transfer and response parsing worked correctly.  

4. **Final Connection**  
   - Linked the frontend to the backend API.  
   - Validated everything by displaying fetched data on the webpage.  

---

## **Postman** 🛠️  
- **Learned Tools:**  
  - Testing with `GET` requests and ensuring correct endpoint URL.  
  - Debugging responses and understanding error codes (e.g., `404`, `500`).  
  - Quickly iterating on backend changes and retesting.  

- **Best Practices Adopted:**  
  - Double-checking headers and body configurations before sending requests.  
  - Maintaining consistency in endpoint paths between Postman and frontend.  

---

## **Improvements for Next Time** 🔧  
1. **Documentation**  
   - Create a clear checklist for backend setup to avoid repeating mistakes.  

2. **Postman Usage**  
   - Save frequently used requests in Postman collections for reusability.  

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Add more robust error handling for backend endpoints to return clear messages.  

4. **Debugging Workflow**  
   - Improve coordination between Postman tests and frontend integration to minimize delays.
