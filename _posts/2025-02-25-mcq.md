Digital Divide (0%) </h1>

<div class="section"> 
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>This was one of my weakest areas, the one question about digital divide, I got incorrect. I struggled with understanding the concept term of what Digital Divide means, and it's impacting in computing.</p>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Example Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q61: With this question, I got it partially wrong because, I didn't understand how digital divide works, because we haven't really covered Big Idea 5 in depth, I did get part of problem right because of process of elimnation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Solutions to Improve</h2>
        <ul class="solution-list">
            <li><strong>AP Classroom Daily Video</strong> I'll practice by watching the recommended AP classroom videos for this topic that is recommended on the practice quiz, so I become better at applying.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Practice Problems:</strong> I’ll go online to Khan Academy every day for 20 min, and find practice problems, to strengthen my skills, so next time, I will become better at understanding Digital Divide. </li>
        </ul>

<div class="section"> 
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>This was also one of my weakest areas, scoring only 33%. I got this question wrong because I am not overly familiar with concepts from Big Idea 5, and I didn't really fully understand to concepts required for question.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q9: With this question, I got it wrong because I didn't understand some of the highest security measures when safely transmiting private data. I understand Big idea 4 the internet, but I didn't understand it's connection to Big Idea 5.</li>
        </ul>
