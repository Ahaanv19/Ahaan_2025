# College Panel Reflection Blog

## Overview of the Panel

The college panel provided valuable insight into why the speakers chose computer science as a career path and how their high school experiences prepared them for college-level work. Hearing directly from students who are currently studying computer science made the pathway from high school to college feel much more real and achievable.

The panelists emphasized that **project-based learning**, particularly in Mr. Mortenson’s AP CSP and AP CSA classes, played a major role in helping them succeed in their computer science majors. They explained that working on long-term, collaborative projects helped them build confidence, technical depth, and problem-solving skills. Listening to their experiences helped me better understand the **real-world relevance** of what we do in class and how these skills directly translate to college coursework and future careers.

## Connection Between High School and College Computer Science

One example that stood out to me was a panelist from UCLA who had taken both AP CSP and AP CSA. They explained that in one of their college software engineering courses, they were required to build a **full-stack application**, which was almost identical to projects they had already completed in Mr. Mortenson’s class. This was especially inspiring because it showed that the work we do now is not just practice—it is preparation.

This connection made me realize that skills such as:
- Frontend and backend development  
- Version control with GitHub  
- Debugging and testing  
- Team-based development  

are not just high school assignments, but foundational skills that continue into college and professional environments.

Additionally, the panelists highlighted the importance of **explaining code clearly**. Writing meaningful commit messages, using comments effectively, and making sure everyone on a team understands how the code works were all described as essential skills. This reinforced the idea that computer science is not just about writing code, but also about **communicating ideas clearly and working collaboratively**.

## Importance of Communication and Teamwork

A major theme of the panel was communication. The speakers stressed that communication is just as important—if not more important—than technical ability. Being able to clearly explain ideas, ask questions, and give constructive feedback helps teams function more effectively and allows individuals to grow within companies and organizations.

The panelists also described how their college classes are structured very similarly to our class. They use:
- Scrums  
- Scrum masters  
- Frontend and backend team roles  

This mirrors the workflow we follow in Mr. Mortenson’s class, which showed me that our classroom environment is intentionally designed to prepare us for **real-world software development practices**.

Another key takeaway was the importance of **discussing problems openly**. By talking through challenges as a team, students are better able to understand issues, learn from each other, and find effective solutions. This kind of collaboration leads to greater success and stronger learning outcomes.

## College, Internships, and Career Preparation

The panelists shared how they used their computer science experience to gain internships, research opportunities, and access to advanced coursework. One concept that stood out to me was **customer research**. Understanding the needs of users and building projects with real-world impact was emphasized as a valuable skill for both internships and college projects.

This encouraged me to think more intentionally about:
- Who my projects are for  
- What problem they are solving  
- How users will interact with them  

They also explained that Del Norte’s coursework prepares students not only for computer science, but for the overall demands of college. Skills such as **time management, perseverance, public speaking, collaboration, and adaptability** were repeatedly mentioned as essential tools for success in higher education and beyond.

## Personal Reflection and Areas for Growth

As a result of this panel discussion, I have identified several areas where I want to continue improving:

### Encouraging Open Communication Within My Team
I want to be more proactive about sharing ideas, asking questions, and making sure everyone feels comfortable speaking up. Creating an environment where everyone contributes leads to stronger projects and better teamwork.

### Improving Presentation and Feedback Skills
Clear explanations and constructive feedback are essential for both teamwork and personal growth. I want to become more confident when presenting my ideas and more thoughtful when giving feedback to others.

### Reducing Stress Through Balance
The panel reminded me that it is important not to stress excessively about high school. Many panelists emphasized that the challenges they faced taught them **grit, perseverance, and confidence**—skills that helped them succeed in college. This helped me realize that growth comes from challenges, and that maintaining balance is just as important as working hard.

## Final Takeaway

Overall, the college panel helped me better understand how my current experiences in computer science are shaping my future. It reassured me that the skills I am developing now—both technical and interpersonal—will continue to support me in college, internships, and my career. The panel left me feeling more confident, motivated, and intentional about my path in computer science.
