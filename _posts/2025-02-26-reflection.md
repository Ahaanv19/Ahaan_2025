# **Final Exam Retrospective: Personal Reflection and Looking Forward**

## **Introduction**
The final retrospective serves as a deep reflection on my work over the past trimester. It’s an opportunity to assess my strengths, weaknesses, and key takeaways while also setting goals for my future in computer science. Beyond just technical skills, this process helps refine problem-solving abilities, collaboration, and self-improvement strategies. 

This retrospective will cover:
- Reflection on strengths and weaknesses.
- Next steps in my computer science journey.
- Engagement with peers and external projects.
- Key lessons learned and how they shape my growth.
- Summary of my self-assessment.

## **Personal Strengths and Achievements**
Reflecting on the past trimester, I’ve identified several areas where I excelled:

1. **Full-Stack Development Mastery**
   - Successfully built and deployed a full-stack project integrating frontend and backend.
   - Utilized **GitHub Pages** for frontend hosting and **AWS EC2** for backend deployment.
   - Implemented RESTful APIs to facilitate seamless communication between components.

2. **Effective Debugging and Problem-Solving**
   - Tackled bugs efficiently using logging tools, debugging strategies, and stack traces.
   - Applied test-driven development (TDD) to ensure reliability in backend functionality.
   - Refactored inefficient code to enhance performance and maintainability.

3. **Networking and Security Awareness**
   - Gained hands-on experience with **Nginx** as a reverse proxy for better traffic management.
   - Implemented **HTTPS security** using Certbot to prevent data interception.
   - Understood network layers and how requests travel through the internet.

4. **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**
   - Assisted peers in debugging issues related to frontend-backend interactions.
   - Engaged in meaningful discussions during **N@tM (Night at the Museum)** to explain my project.
   - Reviewed other students' work and provided constructive feedback.

5. **Connection to College Board CPT Requirements**
   - Demonstrated clear alignment with CPT expectations:
     - **Data abstraction** through structured SQL database management.
     - **Algorithm development** in CRUD operations and API calls.
     - **Security measures** such as authentication and encryption.

## **Challenges and Areas for Improvement**
No learning journey is without challenges. Here are the areas I aim to improve:

1. **Time Management in Large-Scale Projects**
   - I sometimes underestimated the time required for debugging and testing.
   - In future projects, I will implement structured sprints and maintain a burndown chart to track progress.

2. **Advanced Security Implementations**
   - While I implemented JWT authentication, I want to explore **OAuth 2.0** for more robust security.
   - Understanding encryption protocols and how they apply to web applications will be a focus moving forward.

3. **Scalability Considerations**
   - The current project works well on a small scale, but I need to explore:
     - Load balancing strategies.
     - Efficient database indexing.
     - Serverless architecture (AWS Lambda, Firebase, etc.) for scalability.

4. **Expanding My Tech Stack**
   - I am comfortable with **Flask and JavaScript**, but I want to:
     - Learn **React.js** for more dynamic frontend development.
     - Experiment with **Django** as an alternative backend framework.
     - Work with **GraphQL** for more efficient data fetching.

## **Engagement and Collaboration**
### **Impact at N@tM and Beyond**
At **Night at the Museum (N@tM)**, I actively engaged with visitors, explaining the intricacies of my project. Through these interactions, I:
- Gained insights into how non-technical users perceive my application.
- Received constructive feedback that led to refining my UI and error handling.
- Developed stronger presentation skills by simplifying complex technical concepts.

Additionally, I took a strong interest in **other students' projects**, analyzing their approaches and learning from their implementations. This inspired me to integrate better **frontend design patterns** in future projects.

### **Helping Peers and Strengthening the Community**
To contribute to the learning environment, I:
- Assisted a peer in debugging their API connection issues.
- Conducted a **preliminary live review** session with another student to prepare for the final assessment.
- Compiled and shared resources on AWS deployment, making it easier for classmates to follow best practices.

These interactions reinforced the importance of **collaboration in tech**, as no project exists in isolation.

## **Looking Forward: Next Steps in Computer Science**
### **Short-Term Goals**
- Complete a mini-project using **React.js** to gain hands-on experience.
- Experiment with **Docker and Kubernetes** for containerized deployments.
- Work on an **open-source project** to contribute to the developer community.

### **Long-Term Goals**
- Explore **AI and Machine Learning** as a potential career direction.
- Secure an internship related to **web development or cybersecurity**.
- Continue refining my **technical writing skills** by maintaining a development blog.

## My Aspiration: Video Game Development  

From a young age, video games have fascinated me—not just as a form of entertainment, but as an art form that combines creativity, logic, and problem-solving. I want to invest my computer science journey into game development, where I can bring ideas to life through code, design, and interactive storytelling.  

To achieve this, I plan to deepen my understanding of game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, learning C# and C++ to build immersive experiences. I also want to explore AI-driven game mechanics, physics simulations, and multiplayer networking, as these aspects create the depth and realism that make games engaging.  

Beyond technical skills, I aim to collaborate with other developers, designers, and artists to gain real-world experience. Game jams, open-source projects, and internships will be key steps in refining my abilities. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the gaming industry, whether by working at a game studio or developing my own indie projects.  

Through this journey, I see video game development as more than just coding—it’s about crafting experiences that captivate, challenge, and inspire players. This blend of technology and creativity is why I am committed to making game development my career.  


## **Final Self-Assessment and Summary**
