Binary Numbers (50%) </h1>

<div class="section"> 
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>This was one of my weakest areas, scoring only 50%. I struggled with understanding how to convert regular integer numbers to Binary form, and then applying those skills to question scenarios like bytes.</p>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Example Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q28: With this question, I got it wrong because, I didn't understand binary sequence, and I didn't understand the logic of bits, therefore as a result I wasn't able to understand how to apply that knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Mistake 2:</strong> Q42: In this question, I got it wrong because, I did not understand Internet Protocol Version, and how each version is represented with different bit binary numbers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Solutions to Improve</h2>
        <ul class="solution-list">
            <li><strong>AP Classroom Daily Video</strong> I'll practice by watching the recommended AP classroom videos for this topic that is recommended on the practice quiz, so I become better at applying.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Practice Problems:</strong> I’ll go online to Khan Academy every day for 20 min, and find practice problems, to strengthen my skills, so next time, I will become better at Booleans. </li>
        </ul>

Conditionals (50%) </h1>

<div class="section"> 
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>This was also one of my weakest areas, scoring only 50%. I struggled with understanding how to identify nested conditionals especially, and how to apply the logic in conditionals  like when it comes to robot programming and trying to navigate an object to a certain destination.</p>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Example Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q26: With this question, I got it wrong because I didn't understand robot programming and I didn't understand/ couldn't correctly split around the conditionals to determine how to get the robot to reach the grey square. I need to work on these kind of problems</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Solutions to Improve</h2>
        <ul class="solution-list">
            <li><strong>AP Classroom Daily Video</strong> I'll practice by watching the recommended AP classroom videos for this topic that is recommended on the practice quiz, so I become better at applying.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Practice with IF, ELIF, and ELSE statements:</strong> I’ll go online to Khan Academy every day for 20 min, and find practice problems, to strengthen my skills, and I will also practice creating my scenarios where I identify on what conditions are true. This task will be carried out. </li>
        </ul>

Iteration (50%) </h1>

<div class="section"> 
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>This was another one of my weakest areas, scoring only 50%. I do understand iterations and loops, it was just me not reading the question correctly and forgetting a bit of the structure of iterations</p>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Example Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q56: This question I got incorrect because I forgot that iterations start at 0, not 1, so twenty times would go to 19 if we include 0.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Solutions to Improve</h2>
        <ul class="solution-list">
            <li><strong>AP Classroom Daily Video</strong> I'll regain my understanding by watching the recommended videos for this topic so I can make sure to remember this mistake fact.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-Reading Question:</strong> I’ll make sure that I reread the question before choosing an answer, in which, I can easily catch mistakes like this. </li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q31: This question I got incorrect because I wasn't able to correctly identify and interpret the correct movements of the robot, to get to the target. I should draw a diagram to represent the moves.</li>
            <li><strong>Mistake 2:</strong> Q37: I got this question incorrect because, I misread code segment 2, in which I thought it gave an inaccurate result, but it gave the same answer.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Solutions to Improve</h2>
        <ul class="solution-list">
            <li><strong>AP Classroom Daily Video & More Programing in That Area</strong> I'll regain my understanding by watching the recommended videos for this topic so I can make sure to remember this mistake fact. I will also make sure when I program, I should try my best to make programs with more simplified operations for the most efficiency.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> Q21: This question I got incorrect because I wasn't able to correctly identify and interpret the correct movements of the robot, and I misinterpreted the correct movements for the robot.</li>
            <li><strong>Mistake 2:</strong> Q55: I got this question incorrect because, I misread the conditional statement of this Procedure, which unfortunately led to me calculating and getting the wrong results..</li>
        </ul>
