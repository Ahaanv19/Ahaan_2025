    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Final Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poway Auto** is a full-stack application designed to improve autonomous vehicle navigation using real-time traffic data from the City of Poway. Built in collaboration with PilotCity, this project is the culmination of my computer science learning journey this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combined **machine learning**, **Google Maps API**, and custom **Flask backend services** to predict congestion and suggest optimal routes for AV fleets. The platform is hosted using **GitHub Pages** for the frontend and **AWS** for the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 What I Learned This Year\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the year, I developed a wide range of technical and problem-solving skills through real-world coding projects like QCOMM Auto and LitConnect. Here’s a breakdown of the core computer science concepts and tools I mastered:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Programming Fundamentals\n",
    "- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL\n",
    "- **Data Types**: Strings, integers, booleans, arrays, dictionaries, JSON, and SQLite tables\n",
    "- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`), string concatenation, comparison\n",
    "- **Control Structures**: \n",
    "  - `if/else` statements for conditionals\n",
    "  - `for` and `while` loops for iteration\n",
    "  - `try/except` in Python and `.then/.catch` in JavaScript for error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧰 Backend Development with Flask\n",
    "- Built REST APIs using Flask routes\n",
    "- Created and managed **SQLite databases** for storing user and traffic data\n",
    "- Used **Postman** for API testing and **JSON** for data exchange\n",
    "- Implemented route logic and congestion prediction using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 Frontend Development\n",
    "- Built interactive web interfaces using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript\n",
    "- Used **DOM manipulation** to update maps, inputs, and outputs dynamically\n",
    "- Integrated frontend with backend using **Fetch API**\n",
    "- Validated user input and displayed real-time routing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Testing and Debugging\n",
    "- Debugged JavaScript and Python using browser dev tools and print/log statements\n",
    "- Used `console.log`, `try/except`, and breakpoints to isolate logic errors\n",
    "- Designed routes to handle invalid inputs and edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Software Engineering Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂️ Source Control & Collaboration\n",
    "- Used **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration\n",
    "- Created branches and pull requests (PRs)\n",
    "- Reviewed teammate code and merged features after testing\n",
    "- Managed tasks through GitHub Issues and Project Boards\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Agile & Iterative Development\n",
    "- Practiced agile sprints with planning, testing, and retrospectives\n",
    "- Used **checklists and burndown goals** to track weekly progress\n",
    "- Held **live reviews** and team retrospectives to iterate on features\n",
    "- Achieved milestones like database setup, deployment, and live map integration\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Micro-Credential: Critical Thinking with Design Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most valuable lessons I learned was how to apply **Design Thinking** to solve complex problems. Through the BYU micro-credential, I followed this problem-solving model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand**: Researched Poway's traffic system and open data\n",
    "- **Explore**: Brainstormed potential routing features for AVs\n",
    "- **Experiment**: Built and tested a congestion prediction prototype\n",
    "- **Reflect**: Reviewed how users (and the bot) reacted to route feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "This process helped me not only code better but think more like an engineer. It also shaped how I approached the UI and experience of Poway Auto — from how input is entered to how traffic output is visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Project Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🌐 Created a fully working full-stack application with real-time feedback\n",
    "- 💡 Demonstrated ability to integrate **machine learning** and **mapping APIs**\n",
    "- 📊 Applied skills from every unit of AP CSP — data, logic, design, and deployment\n",
    "- 🤝 Presented the project to Qualcomm engineers and PilotCity leaders\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Final Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Poway Auto pushed me to grow beyond just writing code. It helped me learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break big problems into manageable steps\n",
    "- Work collaboratively and lead development efforts\n",
    "- Build with real-world users and systems in mind\n",
    "- Connect classroom learning with real tech solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "This final project has inspired me to continue building technology that solves real problems. I now feel more confident in Python, Flask, Git, APIs, and system design — and I’m excited to take on new challenges in computer science.\n",
