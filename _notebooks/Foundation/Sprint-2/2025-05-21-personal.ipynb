    "#  Poway Auto: Smarter Navigation Through Code and Collaboration\n",

    "**Author:** Ahaan Vaidyanathan  \n",
    "**Email:** ahaanvk@gmail.com  \n",
    "**School:** Del Norte High School, Class of 2027  \n",

    "## Final Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poway Auto** is a real-world full-stack application that optimizes routing for autonomous vehicles using **real-time open data** from the City of Poway. This project was built in collaboration with **PilotCity** as part of a real internship, representing a capstone achievement in both my academic and technical development.\n",
    "\n",
    "My application blends:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Machine Learning** to predict congestion patterns  \n",
    "-  **Google Maps API** to visualize routes in real time  \n",
    "-  **Flask (Python)** to manage backend APIs and SQLite databases  \n",
    "-  **AWS EC2** for live backend deployment  \n",
    "-  **GitHub Pages** for frontend deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Poway Auto reflects the **HyFlex learning model** and the vision of the **Open Coding Society**, where students earn **microcredentials** (certificates) for technical mastery and **NFTs** for personalized, creative contributions.\n",
    "\n",

    "##  Microcredentials & Open Coding Society Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren’t just certificates — they are **evidence** of lots of effort, cross-functional learning, and meaningful contributions to a real-world product. Here's why I’ve *earned* each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Certificates (Foundational Technical Mastery)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Certificate | Why I Earned It — Detailed Justification |\n",
    "|-------------|------------------------------------------|\n",
    "|  **Tools Basics Certificate** | I learned Git and GitHub inside and out — from making branches, handling merge conflicts, to using CLI and GUI to push commits. I also wrote clean, detailed commit messages, helped organize sprints on GitHub Projects, and documented my own progress. I understand the role of tools in collaboration — not just code pushing, but syncing development across real-world teams. |\n",
    "|  **GitHub Pages Certificate** | I built a working frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted it live on GitHub Pages. But I went beyond basic deployment — I configured routing paths, managed repo structure for clean deployment, and kept the site updated with every feature cycle. I treated deployment like a DevOps engineer — tracking file integrity, update cycles, and loading performance. |\n",
    "|  **JavaScript Essentials Certificate** | JavaScript was the heart of my frontend — I used event listeners, `fetch()`, and custom functions to render map data, cards, and error handling. But I also learned how to debug async issues, protect input forms, and design reusable, clean functions. I understand JS not just as a language, but as the **logic layer** that connects user interaction to back-end computation. |\n",
    "|  **Data Analysis with Python Certificate** | I used Python for every backend route — parsing JSON, converting query parameters, validating inputs, and calculating traffic predictions. I integrated `pandas` to simulate future use with machine learning, and worked with SQLite to persist user and route data. I wrote queries, updated tables, and handled exceptions. This shows I can handle real-world data processing, not just basic syntax. |\n",
    "|  **Deployment - Linux/Cyber Concepts Certificate** | I deployed a live backend using Ubuntu EC2 on AWS. I learned system-level tools like `ufw`, `apt`, and `gunicorn`, configured firewalls, handled IP/port management, and ran Flask behind an NGINX reverse proxy. I understand how production systems are built and secured. No tutorial — just me, the server, and a goal to make it real. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "###  NFTs (Unique, Creative Contributions)\n",
    "\n",
    "| NFT | Why I Deserve It — Detailed Justification |\n",
    "|-----|-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "|  **Personalized Website NFT** | Every part of my UI — from the way the cards animate, to how inputs are grouped, to how errors are handled with alerts — was fully designed and implemented by me. I didn’t use templates. I planned the experience, built it with HTML/JS, tested it, and improved it across sprints. This site isn’t just functional — it’s a personalized product that reflects my design and engineering decisions. |\n",
    "|  **Innovative Cybersecurity Tool NFT** | While most students stop at “it works,” I designed backend logic to prevent SQL injection, incorrect input crashing the app, or unauthorized API requests. I used `try/except`, validated route parameters, and documented secure API responses. I thought like an ethical hacker and wrote like a secure engineer — showing I understand **real cybersecurity principles** applied to code. |\n",
    "|  **Design Thinking NFT** | I didn’t just code features — I followed the full design thinking model: research, prototype, test, and iterate. I designed with empathy for AV developers and urban planners. I considered data latency, visual UX, map clutter, and usability. I adjusted based on real feedback, not assumptions. This NFT shows I don’t just build — I design with purpose and intent. |\n",
    "|  **PilotCity Industry Collaboration NFT** | I earned this NFT by getting an intership with PilotCity. I demoed my backend, took critiques, and even refactored logic based on their ideas. I communicated clearly, wrote technical documentation, and handled presentations with industry-level professionalism. This wasn’t school — it was real. And I showed up, delivered, and improved every week. |\n",

    "##  BYU Microcredential: Design Thinking & Critical Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the **Design Thinking Microcredential** I earned in 2024 through Brigham Young University, and applied it to my Poway Auto project by engaging deeply with every stage of human-centered problem solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "###  My Application of the 5 Stages — In Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empathize**  \n",
    "   I explored traffic data and interviewed users and mentors. I imagined what autonomous vehicles struggle with — from GPS rerouting delays to lack of live traffic prediction. I didn’t just guess; I **understood the real-world user problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define**  \n",
    "   I narrowed it down: AVs need a way to optimize routes *before* traffic becomes a problem. This defined my entire backend logic — predicting congestion based on real inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ideate**  \n",
    "   I mapped ideas, drew UI sketches, and outlined how map overlays would work. I explored alternatives — like tabular vs card outputs, and discussed tradeoffs with peers and mentors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prototype**  \n",
    "   I built an initial working product — functional Flask API, connected to a simple JS/HTML frontend. I tested with real inputs, got console errors, fixed them, and iterated fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test & Reflect**  \n",
    "   I demoed my app to engineers and my class. I listened to what confused them or failed, and redesigned the form structure, map interaction, and response messages. **This wasn't guessing — it was feedback-informed product development**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This microcredential isn't just a badge I earned — it showcases my ability to effectively identify a problem, and find an efficent solution. It's a reflection of my **deep capability to analyze, design, build, test, and revise** in a real-world context. That’s why I earned it.\n",
