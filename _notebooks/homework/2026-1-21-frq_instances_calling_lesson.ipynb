    "An area of struggle for me is using the correct syntax when writing my class. I will have the correct idea on how to write the correct code, by planning out a pysudocode verison in my head and then thinking about how that would be written in Java. I understand how to write the code but, sometimes I make mistakes with my syntax which happened many times for example forgetting semicolon, incorrect bracket, didn't indent correctly. These errors caused the code runner to have an error and it allowed me to debug. This is something i should work on fixing and improving, so I get better with avoiding syntax errors on AP Exam."
