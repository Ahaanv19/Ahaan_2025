    "*Which format would you use for an image with a transparent background that needs to stay sharp on any screen?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "**SVG** â€“ Scalable Vector Graphics stay crisp on any screen size **and** support transparency.  \n",
    "- **Why not PNG?** PNG also supports transparency, but itâ€™s a raster format and can get pixelated when scaled up.  \n",

    "- JPEG doesn't support transparency.  \n",
    "- GIF only supports 1-bit transparency and limited colors.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is a hex color code? What are some examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hex color code** is a six-digit code used in web development and design to represent colors. It starts with a `#` and is followed by a combination of numbers (0â€“9) and letters (Aâ€“F).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `#FF0000` = Red  \n",
    "- `#00FF00` = Green  \n",
    "- `#0000FF` = Blue  \n",

    "ðŸ”Ž **Application Example:**  \n",
    "In my web project, I used `#1E90FF` (DodgerBlue) for button backgrounds to make them visually pop.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is Base64 and how is it used with images?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base64** is a way of encoding binary data (like images) into a **text** format using only printable characters. It's often used to embed images directly into HTML or CSS without separate image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of loading an image file from disk or the internet, the image is encoded as a long Base64 string.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Application Example:**  \n",
    "In a notebook or web prototype, I used Base64 to embed icons directly into the HTML, reducing external file dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why might you use Base64 instead of a regular image file?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons to use Base64:**\n",
    "- Embeds image data directly into code (no extra requests).\n",
    "- Useful for **small images** like logos, favicons, or UI icons.\n",
    "- Improves load speed for very lightweight pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When not to use:**\n",
    "- Not ideal for **large images** due to increased file size (Base64 adds ~33% overhead).\n",
    "- Difficult to maintain or swap out without decoding.\n",
