    "\n",
    "Q: What would be a reason to use random algorithms in real-life coding situations?\n",
    "- Answer: To make programs more efficient, simulate real-world situations (like weather or behavior), create variety (like in games), or ensure fairness (like randomized trials or voting).\n",
