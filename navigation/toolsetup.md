<p style="font-size:90%; color: Red; font: bold 18px Arial, sans-serif;">Week 0-1: set up my tools by viewing the nighthawk github website and following step by step to make sure all the needed files and tools like homebrew were added. To make sure all my tools were installed, I typed commands like ruby, python in the terminal to make sure all the needed files and downloads are installed. The journey was long and pretty tedious, but I knew once I could get a link to my GitHub Website that I did everything correctly, and my long journey off tool setup was finally over. </p>

 <p style="font-size:90%; color: Orange; font: bold 18px Arial, sans-serif;">Week 2: This week I learned how to add a button to my github page which will allow me to click it, and link it to my India Blog, the topic I chose to create with my partner. It wasn't too diffcult to excute, I used the HREF atribute to add a link, however I just made the link, connect to the post I made with the India Blog. Then, once I got the link and added an atribute, I assigned a class for it called button-link, so I could customize my buttons with CSS. I then repeated the same process for two other buttons, but those were linked to things like w3 schools for learning how to code and also Del Norte Website. I was able to get the mario code from the main Nighthawk student page where I also had to upload the image animations for Mario. Creating the Submenu wasn't too diffcult just made a table, and linked the buttons/links to my posts and pages I created on various pages. This is where I put the partner showcase as well, as well with some other pages.  </p>

 
 <p style="font-size:90%; color: Blue; font: bold 18px Arial, sans-serif;">Week 3: This week after the first progress check review, we started working on adding Jupyter Notebooks and Javascript Games. The Javascript games were pretty easy to add I asked chat gpt for the codes, and I altred them to my likings. However, my Jupyter Notebooks was having an issue where it wasn't converting. I had to open my vs code from terminal instead of directly from my installement. This helped fix the problem. </p>

 <p style="font-size:90%; color: Purple; font: bold 18px Arial, sans-serif;">Week 4: This week was the final week of working on Sprint 1. I used this week to refine my Github page, and complete my student self checklist, making sure all my hacks were installed correctly. I also added my utterances which took some time, but works perfectly now. </p>
