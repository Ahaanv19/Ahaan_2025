<p style="font-size:90%; color: Red; font: bold 18px Arial, sans-serif;">I set up my tools by viewing the nighthawk github website and following step by step to make sure all the needed files and tools like homebrew were added. To make sure all my tools were installed, I typed commands like ruby, python in the terminal to make sure all the needed files and downloads are installed. The journey was long and pretty tedious, but I knew once I could get a link to my GitHub Website that I did everything correctly, and my long journey off tool setup was finally over. </p>
