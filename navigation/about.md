<p style="font-size:100%; color: MediumSeaGreen; font: italic bold 20px Arial, sans-serif;"> Hello my name is Ahaan and I am a 10th grader aka Sophmore. I lived in San Diego all my life, and was born downtown. I love to play video games on my Nintendo Switch esspecially Pokemon, and my favorite foods are Chicken and Pizza. My goals after high school is to work in video game devlopment either as a programmer or designer. I am excited to dive deeper into computer science in order to achieve my goals. My family is from India, but I was born here in the USA, and I've grown attached to life in the USA. I visit India every so often but, not my favorite place to visit, especially during the summer. My favorite sports are basketball and swim, but I can't dive without getting bellyflopped. I know how to code in Python and a little bit of HTML, the project level I can do for Python is pretty intermidete level.   &#128513; </p>
